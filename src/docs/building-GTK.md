Build Instructions for GTK Wisp
==================================

This document provides instructions for building the GTK version of Wisp
and provides guidance on obtaining Wisp's build dependencies.

GTK Wisp has been tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora 8, FreeBSD, NetBSD and
Solaris 10.  Wisp requires at minimum GTK 2.12.


Quick Start
-----------

See the QUICK-START document, which provides a simple environment with
which you can fetch, build and install Wisp and its dependencies.

The QUICK-START is the recommended way to build Wisp.


Manual building
---------------

If you can't follow the quick start instructions, you will have to build
Wisp manually.  The instructions for doing this are given below.


Obtaining the build dependencies
--------------------------------

Many of Wisp's dependencies are packaged on various operating systems.
Most core Wisp libraries (libcss, libdom, etc.) are now bundled in the
`contrib/` directory of the source tree.

### Package installation

Debian-like OS:

    $ sudo apt-get install cmake libgtk-3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
        libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libwebp-dev libavif-dev \
        libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev \
        libavutil-dev gperf libutf8proc-dev libpsl-dev

Recent OS versions might need libcurl4-dev instead of libcurl3-dev but
note that when it has not been built with OpenSSL, the SSL_CTX is not
available and results that certification details won't be presented in case
they are invalid.  But as this is currently unimplemented in the GTK
flavour of Wisp, this won't make a difference at all.

Fedora:

    $ yum install curl-devel libpng-devel
    $ yum install librsvg2-devel expat-devel

Other:

You'll need to install the development resources for libglade2, libcurl3,
libpng and librsvg.


### Preparing your workspace

Wisp has a number of libraries which must be built in-order and
installed into your workspace. Each library depends on a core build
system which Wisp projects use. This build system relies on the
presence of things like pkg-config to find libraries and also certain
environment variables in order to work correctly.

Assuming you are preparing a workspace in /home/wisp/workspace then
the following steps will set you up:

### Make the workspace directory and change to it

    $ mkdir -p ${HOME}/wisp/workspace
    $ cd ${HOME}/wisp/workspace

### Make the temporary install space

    $ mkdir inst

### Make an environment script

    $ cat > env.sh <<'EOF'
      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${HOME}/wisp/workspace/inst/lib/pkgconfig::
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/wisp/workspace/inst/lib
      export PREFIX=${HOME}/wisp/workspace/inst
      EOF

### Change to workspace and source the environment

Whenever you wish to start development in a new shell, run the following:

    $ cd ${HOME}/wisp/workspace
    $ source env.sh

From here on, any commands in this document assume you have sourced your
shell environment.


### The Wisp project's libraries

The Wisp project has developed several libraries which are required by
the browser. These are:

| BuildSystem    | Shared build system, needed to build the other libraries |
| LibParserUtils | Parser building utility functions                        |
| LibWapcaplet   | String internment                                        |
| Hubbub         | HTML5 compliant HTML parser                              |
| LibCSS         | CSS parser and selection engine                          |
| LibNSGIF       | GIF format image decoder                                 |
| LibNSBMP       | BMP and ICO format image decoder                         |
| LibROSprite    | RISC OS Sprite format image decoder                      |

To fetch each of these libraries, run the appropriate commands from the
Docs/LIBRARIES file, from within your workspace directory.

To build and install these libraries, simply enter each of their directories
and run:

    $ make install

> Note:
> 
> We advise enabling iconv() support in libparserutils, which vastly
> increases the number of supported character sets.  To do this,
> create a file called Makefile.config.override in the libparserutils
> directory, containing the following line:
>
>     CFLAGS += -DWITH_ICONV_FILTER
>
> For more information, consult the libparserutils README file.

Now you should have all the Wisp project libraries built and installed.


### Getting the Wisp source

From your workspace directory, run the following command to get the Wisp
source:

    $ git clone git://git.netsurf-browser.org/netsurf.git

And change to the 'wisp' directory:

    $ cd wisp

Building and executing Wisp
------------------------------

Wisp uses CMake for building.

Once dependencies are installed, to build GTK Wisp on a UNIX-like platform:

    $ cmake -B build -DWISP_BUILD_GTK_FRONTEND=ON
    $ make -C build -j$(nproc)

Run Wisp by executing the binary:

    $ ./build/frontends/gtk/wisp-gtk


### Builtin resources

There are numerous resources that accompany Wisp, such as the
image files for icons, cursors and the ui builder files that
construct the browsers interface.

Some of these resources can be compiled into the browser executable
removing the need to install these resources separately. The GLib
library on which GTK is based provides this functionality to
Wisp.

Up until GLib version 2.32 only the GDK pixbuf could be integrated
in this way and is controlled with the WISP_USE_INLINE_PIXBUF
variable (set in makefile.config).

Glib version 2.32 and later integrated support for any file to be a
resource while depreciating the old inline pixbuf interface. Wisp
gtk executables can integrate many resources using this interface,
configuration is controlled with the WISP_USE_GRESOURCE variable.

Loading from file is the fallback if a resource has not been
compiled in, because of this if both of these features are
unavailable (or disabled) Wisp will automatically fall back to
loading all its resources from files.

The resource initialisation within the browser ensures it can access
all the resources at start time, however it does not verify the
resources are valid so failures could still occur subsequently. This
is especially true for file based resources as they can become
inaccessible after initialisation.


Note for packagers
------------------

If you are packaging Wisp, see the PACKAGING-GTK document.
