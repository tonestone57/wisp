# Wisp

This project is a fork of Netsurf with various fixes and improvements, a new JS engine, and a revamped build system.

## Why?
Wisp has a different development vision from Netsurf. While Netsurf is a browser for the "old web", Wisp aspires to be a browser for the "modern web".
We appreciate the philosophy of Netsurf, and intend to keep the spirit of the project alive: a lean, small, and portable browser.

## Development
Current development is focused on adding compatibility with modern websites, integrating the QuickJS-ng JS engine and porting to different platforms, most notably modern Windows using Direct2D, OS X, Haiku and Remarkable.

## Biggest differences from Netsurf
* Removed compatibility for super old and/or obscure libraries/software/operating systems
* Dedicated LibreSSL support
* Numerous privacy improvements
* Rewritten build system
* Simplified frontend development
* **Modern CSS Features**: Integrated support for CSS Grid, Flexbox, `calc()`, and `position: sticky`.
* **Integrated JS Engine**: Uses QuickJS-ng (v0.15.1) for modern ES2023+ JavaScript support.

## Known Issues
* All other frontends, except for the Qt one on Linux and the GDI one on Windows, are not regularly tested and may have issues.
* CSS Variables support is partially implemented and undergoing active development.

## Building and installation
Wisp can be built:
* On Windows (for the Windows frontend) using MSYS2 and the MinGW-w64 toolchain.
* On Linux (for the Qt frontend) using CMake and ninja or make.

Wisp intends to be portable, keeping a lean C99 codebase and minimal dependencies.

At build-time, Wisp requires the following programs:
* python3
* cmake
* any CMake-compatible build utility (typically make or ninja)
* gperf
* pkg-config or pkgconf
